## What is Python?

Python is a high-level interpreted programming language whose philosophy emphasizes the readability of its code. It is used to develop applications of all types, for example - Instagram, Netflix, Spotify, Panda3D, among others. Python is an interpreted language, which means it directly executes code line by line. If there are errors in the program code, its execution stops. This way, programmers can find errors in the code quickly.

## Introduction

It is a multiparadigm programming language, since it partially supports object orientation, imperative programming and, to a lesser extent, functional programming. It is an interpreted, dynamic and cross-platform language. Administered by the Python Software Foundation, it has an open source license, called the Python Software Foundation License.3​ Python is consistently ranked as one of the most popular programming languages

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial objective of the project. And after that I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for the moment it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

* As soon as the course continues, I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
